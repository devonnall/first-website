            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è How the Website Was Made</h2>
                <p>ChatGPT gave me a coding study plan, and I watched the two YouTube coding tutorials on HTML and CSS. But I also encountered some issues while coding and did some searching online. I'm a beginner, but I already don't know what I would do without Stack Exchange!
                </p>

            <p>Anyway, here is what I prompted ChatGPT with: </p>

            <p class="quote">Act as a coding tutor that creates study plans to help people learn to code. You will be provided with the goal of the student, their time commitment, and resource preferences. You will create a study plan with timelines and links to resources. Only include relevant resources because time is limited. My first request - "I want to become a web developer but I do not know how to code. I can study 20 hours per week and only want video resources. I want to learn to code in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, and maybe other recommended programming languages. Create a study plan for me.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Here is what ChatGPT provided me:</p>

            <div class="quote">

            <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Code</h2>
            <p>You can head over to <a href="https://github.com/devonnall/first-website">GitHub</a> if you want to see my code. The HTML code is heavily based on Travesy Media's example website in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI">"CSS Crash Course for Absolute Beginners"</a> YouTube video.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>üìö Resources Used</h2>
                <p>ChatGPT suggested two YouTube videos, <a href="https://youtu.be/UB1O30fR-EE">"HTML Crash Course for Absolute Beginners"</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/yfoY53QXEnI">"CSS Crash Course for Absolute Beginners"</a>, both by Traversy Media. (ChatGPT really loves this channel.) They're relatively short (~1 hour each) but they cover a lot of material. </p>

                <p>Well I suppose I could use my new knowledge to embed the videos here directly, so here you go: </p>
